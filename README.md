This work aimed to integrate multi-source terrain data in Canada by adopting the ISEA3H DGGS. The modeling process of terrain data in the ISEA3H DGGS had the following main phases: data acquisition, pre-processing, quantization, aggregation, and quality control. The open-sourced library [*dggridR*](https://github.com/r-barnes/dggridR) was used to complete conversion between geographic locations and ISEA3H DGGS cell indices. The modeling process was developed using a hybrid of Python 3.8 and R 3.6.2 environments.

## Abstract
The Canadian Digital Elevation Model (CDEM) and the High Resolution Digital Elevation Model (HRDEM) released by Natural Resources Canada are primary terrain data sources
in Canada. Due to their different coverage, datums, resolutions, and accuracies, a standardized framework for national elevation data across various scales is required. This
study provides new insights into the adoption of Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) to facilitate the integration of multi-source terrain data at various granularities. In particular, the Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area Aperture 3 Hexagonal Grid (ISEA3H) was employed, and quantization, integration, and aggregation were conducted on this framework. To demonstrate the modeling process, an experiment was undertaken for two areas in Ontario, taking advantage of parallel computing which was beneficial from the discreteness of
DGGS cells. The accuracy of the modeled elevations was estimated by referring to the ground-surveyed values and was included in the spatially referenced metadata as an
indicator of data quality. This research can serve as a guide for future development of a national elevation service, providing consistent, multi-resolution elevations and avoiding complex, duplicated pre-processing at the user's end. Future investigation into an operational integration platform to support real-world decision-making, as well as the DGGS-powered geospatial datacube, is recommended.

## Data availability
The original Canadian Digital Elevation Model (CDEM) data can be downloaded via the Geospatial-Data Extraction tool in [Canada's Open Government Portal](https://maps.canada.ca/czs/index-en.html), or they can be obtained through the STAC API as shown in the [sample code](https://github.com/Erin-1919/DGGS-Elevation-Integration/blob/main/Script/01_data_acquisition.py). The High Resolution Digital Elevation Model (HRDEM) data are available at the [data repository](https://ftp.maps.canada.ca/pub/elevation/dem_mne/highresolution_hauteresolution/dtm_mnt). Ground control points are accessible using [COSINE](https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov.on.ca/COSINE/index.html?viewer=COSINE.OntarioViewer&locale=en-CA), Ontarioâ€™s geodetic control database, on the website of [Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry](https://www.ontario.ca/page/geodesy). The conversion grids between CGVD28 and CGVD2013 is stored in the folder [*Data*](https://github.com/Erin-1919/DGGS-Elevation-Integration/tree/main/Data), and it was originally downloaded from the website of [Natural Resources Canada (NRCan)](https://webapp.geod.nrcan.gc.ca/geod/process/download-helper.php?file_id=HT2_2010_CGG2013a), where login is needed. The experimental data, including the study areas (.shp), fishnet grids (.shp), and ground control points (.csv) are available in the folder [*Experiment_data*](https://github.com/Erin-1919/DGGS-Elevation-Integration/tree/main/Experiment_data).

## Experiment note
The experiment was carried out on the Advanced Research Computing cluster at the University of Calgary. To improve the computational efficiency and take advantage of the discrete property of DGGS cells, the modeling process ran in a parallelism fashion, which was a hybrid of the shared-memory parallelism and the job-level parallelism. Sample job scripts sent to the high-performance cluster are provided in the folder [*Sample_job_script*](https://github.com/Erin-1919/DGGS-Elevation-Integration/tree/main/Sample_job_script).
